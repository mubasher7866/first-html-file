            <p> Hello, Welcome to my website where i post the photos which i have taken from around the world.
							 Travelling and enjoying the nature is my passion and i love to capture my special moments into the camera.
							 Because of my obsession for travel photograpghy, i made this website to show my experience with others.
							 Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
						<h2 style="color:black;"> Here are some of the photos which i took recently. </h2>
				</div>
				<div id="image2">
					<img src="images/park.jpg" alt="Picture of a lake" width="250" height="250"/>
					<img src="images/Powerscourt.jpg" alt="Picture of a lake" width="250" height="250"/>
					<img src="images/Howth.jpg" alt="Picture of a lake" width="250" height="250"/>
					<img src="images/building.jpg" alt="Picture of a lake" width="250" height="250"/>
					<br>  
					<br>  
				</div>
				<p2>So as you can see from above images that i have travelled to few places
				in ireland and want to travel to every single place in ireland to capture its beauty inside my camera
			forever.</p2>
